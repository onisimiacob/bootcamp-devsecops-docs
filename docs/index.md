# :shield: DevSecOps Bootcamp Documentation

These are [:octicons-person-fill-16: Onisim Iacob](https://www.linkedin.com/in/onisim-iacob) personal notes for the [:material-web: Techworld-With-Nana DevSecOps Bootcamp](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devsecops-bootcamp) written in with [:simple-materialformkdocs: Mkdocs-Materials](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and deployed on [:simple-github: Github Pages](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/) as a free static site.

## **:material-robot-off: No AI usage**

### *I wanted to ensure every single word comes from my mouth. I do however use AI at work to increase my productivity, but not for this kind of courses.*

## :ballot_box_with_check: To ensure copyright policy

- I will not use any screenshot of the course itself, nor any PDF from [**TechWorld with Nana's DevSecOps Bootcamp :fontawesome-regular-copyright:**](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/).

## :checkered_flag: Objective

- After completing this Bootcamp, hand this static site to validate my new knewledge, in a modern way.

- Have the evidence and hands-on resolution of the exercises.

- I want to keep all this knewledge as a static site for documentation to check it any time I need.

- Static sites like this, on any real project, can give to the DevOps Engineer a huge value.
