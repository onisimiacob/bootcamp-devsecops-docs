# :infinity: DevSecOps Bootcamp Documentation

This documentation are personal [:octicons-person-fill-16: Onisim Iacob](https://www.linkedin.com/in/onisim-iacob) notes without AI usage for the Techworld-With-Nana DevSecOps Bootcamp.

## To ensure copyright policy

- I will not use any screenshot of the course itself, nor any pdf of the documentation, but the evidence and hands-on resolution of the exercises.

## Objective

- After completing this Bootcamp, hand this static site to validate my new knewledge, in a modern usable way.

- I want to keep all this knewledge as a static site for documentation to check it any time I need.

- Static sites like this, on any real project, can give to the DevOps Engineer a huge value.
